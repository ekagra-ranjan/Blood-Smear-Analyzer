# Blood-Smear-Analyzer

Used Image Processing techniques such as hough transform, erosion dilation and blob detection techniques to build a blood smear analyzer that counts the number of RBC, WBC and platelets in low quality smudged microscopic images which helps in diagnosis of anemia and leukopenia.

Notice the algorithm detecs almost all the cells and in fact detects some RBCs which are not present in crudely labeled Gound Truth, as acquiring an accurate labeled dataset is quite expensive.
